## Currently working on:
WOW isn't it blowing your mind to see elegant, exquisite and robust code in every repo? Just kidding, don't go snooping through some of my repos. 
I haven't refactored old code and I do not have enough money to pay for any trauma you may endure from looking at haphazard code or how I deal with React Forms ;)
